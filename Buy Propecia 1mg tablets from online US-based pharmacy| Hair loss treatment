Propecia 1mg tablets are a prescription medication primarily used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). The active ingredient in Propecia is finasteride, which works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone implicated in hair loss. By reducing DHT levels, Propecia helps to slow down hair loss and may promote hair regrowth in some individuals. 
It is typically taken once daily and is most effective when used consistently over time. Propecia is intended for use by adult men only and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
Ordering from a reputable online pharmacy offers convenience and accessibility to this clinically proven treatment option, helping individuals combat hair loss with confidence and discretion.
